All research is fueled by food, so I wondered what food, if any, was fueled by machine learning. These are the results from my time spent reviewing ML use cases in agriculture. Full credits to all the researchers on the final slide. Thank you for the great work you do as a multinational collaborative community. Thanks also to the University of Illinois for their online Agricultural Supply Chain course.
